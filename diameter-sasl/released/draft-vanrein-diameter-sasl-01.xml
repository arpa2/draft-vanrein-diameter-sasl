	<abstract>
	<t>SASL is used for authentication in many application
	protocols.  This specification extends it to allow credentials from
	a home realm to be used against external services.  To this end, it
	introduces a secure end-to-end wrapper for SASL traffic and a link
	back from to the home realm based on Diameter.</t>
	</abstract>

<!--

CHANGES FROM 00 TO 01:
 * General notion of realm crossover, Diameter is "just" a way of doing it
 * SXOVER mechanism for SASL, encrypts a nested SASL mechanism
 * Dropped the SASL-Mechanisms AVP
 * Replaced SASL-Encrypted-Token with a mere SASL-Token
 * Complete rewrite of Introduction and Security Considerations

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>It is common for Internet users to combine services from a varierity of
providers.  Along with this, an ad hoc practice has arisen of using the
local identity schemes of these providers.  These are not integrated, and
the practice tends to reduce the control of
users over their online identity.  A solution to this is generic support
for realm crossover, where an externally acquired service can make a
callback to a home realm to authenticate a user's identity and use that
for service-specific authorisation.</t>

<t>SASL <xref target="RFC4422"/>
is instrumental in authentication across a wide range of application
protocols; it allows those protocols to abstract from the actual authentication
mechanisms, and at the same time it allows authentication mechanisms to not
be concerned about the application protocol.  SASL can easily be funneled
from one protocol into another, modulo a number of security concerns.</t>

<t>Diameter and its Network Access application are instrumental in
authenticating a user under a realm, while not providing the resources
that an application protocol would imply.  Moreover, Diameter service
can be declared under a domain name in a manner that is standardised,
scalable and secure.</t>

<t>This allows a foreign server to authenticate a client to authenticate
with its home realm:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   +--------+    SASL     +--------+    SASL    +---------+
   | Client |-----------> | Server | ---------> |  Realm  |
   +--------+  AppProto   +--------+  Diameter  +---------+
       ||                     ||                    ||
john@example.com        find SRV, TLSA          example.com
  & credential            relay SASL           authentication
]]></artwork></figure></t>

<t>Diameter can send a mere notification of authentication, and the foreign
server can use DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> to validate the origin of
these notification.  Diameter in the foreign server will authenticate to
the home realm, which may then decide to add resources beyond the basic
notification of authentication.</t>

<t>SASL mechanisms are not generally protected against attacks by men
in the middle named Eve.  This is usually compensated for
by wrapping the application protocol in TLS, but since that would only
protect one leg of the intended realm crossover, this raises a need
for end-to-end encryption.  This can be established along with other
credentials for the home realm, but an end-to-end mechanism needs to
be defined.  This specification introduces a wrapper for that pupose,
and nests a SASL exchange with the home realm under its cloak.</t>

<t>Finally, to avoid the use of one authentication exchange to validate
another, it is advisable to incorporate
channel binding <xref target="RFC5056"/> <xref target="RFC5801"/>
when making use
of backends.  When passing SASL tokens between application protocol and
Diameter backend, the channel binding information from the application
protocol would be supplied as a side-note to the Diameter backcall.</t>

</section>

<section title="The SASL crossover mechanism SXOVER" anchor="sxover">

<t>SXOVER is a SASL authentication mechanism that encrypts all
information between a SASL client and SASL server, except for the
realm name to which they direct the authentication.  The realm
can be used by an foreign server to redirect SXOVER to a home
realm, for instance using Diameter.  SXOVER does not reveal success
or failure to this foreign server, but Diameter would release
this information in a manner that requires no knowledge of the
SASL exchange.</t>

<t>The first SXOVER message supplies a session key to the SASL server.
The server responds with a list of SASL mechanisms to be used under
the cloak of the session key.  Then, the client selects a mechanism
and the customary exchange follows, but under protection of the
session key.</t>

<t>All multi-byte integer values in SXOVER are represented
in network byte order.
When these values represent a counter, then it is a 32-bit
unsigned integer whose increment
may wrap around from the highest value to zero.
A NUL byte is a single byte whose bits are all zero; a
NUL-terminated string is a string with no inner NUL and an
additional NUL following it.
Length-prefixed byte strings consist of a 16 bit unsigned integer
up to 65534
with the length followed by that number of bytes with the value.
Optional length-prefixed byte strings can take all values of
length-prefix byte strings or, if they are opted out from, then
their value consists of a 16-but unsigned integere valued 65535.
Certain information in SXOVER is encrypted
with the encrypt operation [Section 3 of <xref target="RFC3961"/>]
with default initial state and key usage TODO; this always includes
integrity protection.</t>

<t>TODO: The number for key usage is KIP_KEYUSAGE_MAPPING and
comes from the Keyful Identity Protocol.</t>

<section title="SXOVER initial response" anchor="sxover-iniresp">

<t>The SXOVER exchange starts with an initial response message,
traveling along the selection of SXOVER as the SASL mechanism.
This initial response contains the following:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="realm">the domain name, in lowercase ASCII and
	no trailing dot, under which the client wants to
	authenticate.  This is a NUL-terminated string.</t>
<t hangText="inictr">is an initial counter value for this SXOVER
	session.  It can be used by the client to keep
	sessions separated for replay prevention.</t>
<t hangText="kvno"> is a 32-bit unsigned integer, holding a
	key version number <xref target="RFC4120"/>
	for a long-term key established between the client and
	its home realm.  To complete the identity of the key,
	the following field is also needed.</t>
<t hangText="enctype"> is a 32-bit signed integer, holding an
	encryption type following the IANA registry for
	Kerberos encryption types.  This field and kvno
	together identify a long-term key shared between the
	client and its realm.</t>
<t hangText="seskey"> provides a random seed from which a session
	key can be formed, encrypted with the long-term key for
	the client and its realm.  The session key will use the
	same enctype, which defines a random-to-key function with
	a required key-generation seed-length [Section 3 of
	<xref target="RFC3961"/>].  Once derived, the session key
	is used for encryption in the remaining SXOVER session.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When this arrives at the foreign server, the domain name can be
tested to see if a session to the realm already exiss; if not, a
lookup of _diameter._sctp SRV records under the realm (which is a
domain name) is used to locate a home realm server to connect to.
Once a session to the domain's Diameter
server is established, the SXOVER token can be forwarded in whole,
including the domain name.</t>

</section>

<section title="SXOVER initial challenge" anchor="sxover-inichal">

<t>The initial SXOVER challenge is a server's response in which it
presents the choice of mechanism names to use under the cloak of
SXOVER.  It does not present any other information.  The following
information is sent as one block under protection of the seskey:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="ctr">is a counter that is incremented
	from the inictr in the initial response.</t>
<t hangText="realm"> repeats the NUL-terminated string with the
	domain name from the initial response.</t>
<t hangText="mechlist"> is a NUL-terminated string with a
	space-separated SASL mechanism names.</t>
<t hangText="chanbindmth"> is a NUL-terminated string with the
	name of a channel binding method.  TODO:REALLY?</t>
<t hangText="chanbindval"> is a length-prefixed string with
	the value of the channel binding.  TODO:REALLY?</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="SXOVER responses" anchor="sxover-resp">

<t>Further SXOVER responses are essentially SASL responses and
initial responses, encrypted
under the seskey, but there is one exception; the first response must
select a SASL mechanism.  There is a separate provision for sending
no data, distinguishable from empty data, if this is desired by the
SASL mechanism:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="ctr"> is a counter, incremented from the prior message
	in this SXOVER session.</t>
<t hangText="opt_mechsel"> is an optional NUL-terminated string.
	In the first SXOVER response after the initial response,
	it MUST be present.  When present, it mentions a SASL
	mechanism name to start under the cloak of SXOVER.</t>
<t hangText="opt_token"> is an optional length-prefixed token for the
	SASL mechanism selected with the most recently provided
	opt_mechsel.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="SXOVER challenges" anchor="sxover-chal">

<t>Further SXOVER challenges are essentially SASL challenges and
initial challenges, encrypted under the seskey.  There is a separate
provision for sending no data, distinguishable from empty data, if
this is desired by the SASL mechanism:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="ctr">is a new 32-bit counter value, 1 more than the
	prior message in the SXOVER session.</t>
<t hangText="opt_token"> is an optional length-prefixed token
	for the selected SASL mechanism that
	is protected by SXOVER.</t>
<t hangText="opt_extra"> is an optional length-prefixed byte string
	with extra information, as provided by SASL alongside a
	successful response.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Embedding SASL in Diameter" anchor="spec">

<t>SASL messages in Diameter use a number of
AVPs <xref target="RFC6733"/> that are
defined for this purposes.  They occur in those combinations
that are defined for SASL.</t>

<t>SASL over Diameter can only be used to relay the SXOVER
mechanism to a home realm.  This means that no negotiation
of mechanisms is needed at the Diameter level; this is handled
under the SXOVER cloak.  The same holds for any negotation
of channel binding; it is part of the cloacked SASL exchange.</t>

<section title="AVP Definitions for SASL" anchor="spec.avps">

<t>These AVPs are added to the set that is used with the
Network Access application, and can therefore be used in
AA-Request and AA-Answer messages.  On top of that, the
SASL-Mechanisms AVP may also occur in a Capabilities
Exchange Answer.  The User-Name AVP MUST be supplied in
the AA-Answer to inform the server about the user name
that the backend decided on; the server MAY send a hint
requesting a value in the User-Name AVP in the AA-Request.</t>

<section title="SASL-Mechanism" anchor="spec.avps.mech">

<t>The SASL-Mechanism AVP has AVP Code TBD0.  This
specification only uses the mechanism name SXOVER as a
value for this AVP.  It MUST be included in the first
message of an SXOVER exchange sent to the home realm,
and it SHOULD be verified by the home realm upon
reception.  Its purpose is mostly to distinguish this
specification from potential future specifications to
encapsulate SASL in Diameter.</t>

<t>Though not used in this specification, this AVP
may also be supplied from the home realm to the Diameter
client to hold a space-separated list of SASL mechanisms.</t>

</section>

<section title="SASL-Token" anchor="spec.avps.token">

<t>The SASL-Token AVP has AVP Code TBD1.  Note that SASL
requires distinction between empty and absent tokens;
absent SASL tokens are represented by absence of the
SASL-Token AVP and empty SASL tokens are represented
as a present SASL-Token AVP with zero content bytes.</t>

</section>

<section title="SASL-Channel-Binding" anchor="spec.avps.chanbind">

<t>The SASL-Channel-Binding AVP has AVP Code TBD2.  It
SHOULD appear along the first SASL-Token AVP for a
Network Access session.  The AVP may occur more than
once, to indicate support of multiple forms of channel
binding.</t>

<t>When the client connects to the foreign service over
TLS, the tls-unique form <xref target="RFC5929"/>
of channel binding is RECOMMENDED.
Specific foreign servers may however be exempted by the
home realm.</t>

<t>The contents of this AVP are:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="name">is the standard name of the channel
	binding information, followed by a zero-valued
	byte.</t>
<t hangText="value">contains the bytes of the channel
	binding information.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Normally, channel binding information should
be sourced from the underlying communications channel, but
this information is not available to backend running Diameter.
To enable channel binding between the end points, the foreign
server incorporates the channel binding information that the
client can use in its connection to the foreign server.  This
is useful to mitigate replay attacks, which is why its use
is RECOMMENDED.  Channel binding provides better guarantees
than the simple inictr/ctr mechanism used in SXOVER.</t>

<section title="Running Diameter as a SASL Backend" anchor="run">

<t>Following are a few practical considerations in relation
to the Diameter connectivity for SASL.</t>

<section title="Diameter is an SCTP service" anchor="run.sctp">

<t>Diameter is primarily an SCTP-based protocol
<xref target="RFC6733"/>,
for reasons of scalabaility and efficiency.  SASL Diameter
benefits from these properties and embraces the SCTP carrier.
Operating system support for SCTP is wide-spread, but
parts of network infrastructure may not support it, and that
may cause implementations to add a fallback to more traditional
protocols.  Standards offer two options for doing this.</t>

<t>Diameter can fallback to run over TCP, which is mostly
of use to client-only machines, but it sacrifices several
benefits of the SCTP carrier.
Since the SASL Diameter embedding typically involves
no client systems, this option is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

<t>SCTP may be run over a UDP transport using port 9899
<xref target="RFC6951"/>, which does not
sacrifice much; it only inserts a UDP header
before each message.  This is a reasonable expectation
of foreign servers as well as home realms, so this additional
option is RECOMMENDED for situations where a fallback
for plain SCTP is desired.  It is standardised as a socket
option SCTP_REMOTE_UDP_ENCAPS_PORT, and only involves a small
repetition in code, with a minor change between the
attempts.</t>

</section>

<section title="Reliance on DANE and DNSSEC" anchor="run.dnssec">

<t>Diameter always involves the use of TLS, but there is a number
of choices concerning the validation of connections through DNSSEC
and DANE.  It is the home realm's prerogative what level of protection
it upholds for its client identities, but any foreign server can
choose to raise the bar by setting a minimum standard.</t>

<t>DNSSEC is a useful protection mechanism for the _diameter._sctp
SRV records that lead to the Diameter host and its port for the home
realm.  This does not protect against forged IP addresses, port
mappings or routing.  To protect against this as well, a TLSA record
for the service host and port, along with the _sctp protocol label,
should be used as specified for DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>.</t>

<t>Home realms that choose to be light on such measures risk that
identities are forged, in spite of their use of TLS.  Foreign
servers MAY choose to reject such home realms, or alternatively be
more inquisitive about the certificates used.</t>

</section>

<section title="Foreign Service SASL Mechanisms" anchor="run.foreignsasl">

<t>A foreign server MUST offer SXOVER if it wants to support realm crossover
via Diameter as specified herein.  In addition, it MAY offer SASL mechanisms
that it resolves locally.</t>

<t>The ANONYMOUS method for SASL <xref target="RFC4505"/> may be offered
for guest access.  The PLAIN method <xref target="RFC4616"/> continues to be
ill-advised, especially with modern methods such as SCRAM <xref target="RFC5802"/>
to address the needs of local accounts with password validation.</t>

<t>The HTTP protocol does not yet support SASL, and it is not optimal from
a security viewpoint to integrate credentials in the dynamic environment of
HTML, where dynamic content from potentially undesirable origins come together
in a manner not controllable to the end user.  One remedy is to use HTTP and
its authentication methods that match with SASL, such as SCRAM for HTTP
<xref target="RFC7804"/>.  Another remedy is to switch to generic
SASL embedding in HTTP [TODO:REF:draft-vanrein-httpauth-sasl] and gain
replay protection through channel binding.</t>

<t>Many application protocols offer richer semantics than HTTP, making them
better targets for automation.  Their reliance on SASL has made them less tractable
as a service to third parties.  One reason for introducing SXOVER is in the
hope to make it possible to have those semantically rich applications as a
third-party offering.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>From the perspective of the client and the home realm, the
safety of the SASL credentials is paramount.  Since not all SASL
mechanisms are safe from inspection by the foreign server, and
since TLS cannot help there either, there is a need for some
caution.</t>

<t>The limitation of the Diameter carrier for SASL to SXOVER
reduces this risk, by only authenticating SASL mechanisms under
end-to-end encryption between the client and home realm.  It
is generally understood that clients must not send unprotected
SASL authentication attempts to arbitrary parties, but SXOVER
adds a facility that is safe for clients to use in this manner.
The SXOVER mechanism could even be used without TLS protection.</t>

<t>From the perspective of the foreign server, the security
concern is to be certain of an identity.  The home realm sends
this information back when SXOVER authentication succeeds,
and the communication doing so is protected with TLS.  The
certificate of the Diameter server can be validated, and for
cautious home realms there could be an additional check
based on DANE.</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This specification defines three AVP Codes for use with Diameter.
IANA registers the following AVP Codes for them in the
"Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters" registry:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
AVP Code | Attribute Name       | Reference

TBD0     | SASL-Mechanism       | (this spec)
